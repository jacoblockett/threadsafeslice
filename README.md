# ThreadSafeSlice

Some utility functions on a wrapper for generic slices with thread safety. I may implement all of the built-in functions from the `slices` package and some seen in other languages at some point, but this is it for now until they become relevant to my workflow.

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/jacoblockett/threadsafeslice
```

You can read the godoc [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jacoblockett/threadsafeslice) for detailed documentation.
